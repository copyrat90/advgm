# advgm

[advgm](https://github.com/copyrat90/advgm) is a DMG VGM music player for the Game Boy Advance.


## History

This project started as a fork of [akkera102's VGM player](https://github.com/akkera102/gbadev-ja-test/tree/main/116_vgm2gba_vblank),
but I've turned it into a seperate repository to properly manage it.
